</header>

<p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;margin-top:5%;">Medigitz is an initiative by 
    <b>EXCEPTION HANDLERS</b> which focuses to improve the health standards of children
and raise them to be healthy citizens.
Many parents are unaware about the vaccination that must be given to kids  at regular intervals.This
ignorance can even cost the life of innocent kids.
Unhealthy food styles of children are making them vulnerable to many lifestyle diseases.Many children are now facing
obesity and undergrowth. This is due to not tracking growth rate according to childâ€™s age.Young parents are generally
confused and worried about parenting. If there is no one to guide them, it will affect the overall development of their child.<br>
<b>WE OFFER A SINGLE SOLUTION TO HELP PARENTS LIKE U TACKLE ALL THESE PROBLEMS.</b>
