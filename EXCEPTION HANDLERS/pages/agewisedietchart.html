<dt><h3>Introduction</h3></dt>
<dd>A healthy diet consumed throughout the life-course helps in preventing malnutrition in all its forms as well as wide range of non-communicable diseases
 (NCDs) and conditions. But rapid urbanization/globalization, increased consumption of processed foods and changing lifestyles has led to a shift in dietary 
 patterns.

People are consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars or salt/sodium, and many do not eat enough fruits,
 vegetables and dietary fibers such as whole grains. So, these all factors are contributing to an imbalanced eating.
				 Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human resource
				development in the country.
Healthy dietary practices begin early in life. Recent evidences indicate that under nutrition in utero may set the pace for diet related chronic 
diseases in later life. Breastfeeding promotes healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may have longer-term health benefits, like reducing the
 risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.
<br>	Since a healthy diet consists of different kinds of foods, the emphasis has been shifted from nutrient orientation to the food based approach.
Foods can be categorized according to the function as- 
</dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Energy rich foods</b> (Carbohydrates and fats)-whole grain cereals, millets, vegetable oils, ghee, nuts and oilseeds and sugars.
<li><b>Body building foods</b> (Proteins)- Pulses, nuts and oilseeds, milk and milk products, meat, fish, poultry.
<li><b>Protective foods </b>(Vitamins and minerals) - Green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk and milk products and flesh foods.
</ul>
<dt><h3>Diet for an Infant<h3></dt>
<dd>
If you have an infant or kid at your place, make sure that they get enough nutrition in their growing years of age.
 Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life. Breast feeding should be started within an hour after delivery and do not discard 
 first milk (colostrum), as it boosts the immunity of the baby and protects baby from several infections. Exclusive breast-feeding ensures safe nutrition to 
 the infant thereby reducing the risk of infections and also helps in the overall development of the baby   Breast-milk is the most natural and wholesome food 
 for growth and healthy development of infants.  Breast –fed infants do not need additional water.  After six months, you can feed your baby with complementary
 foods while continuing to breastfeed. Complementary food should be rich in nutrients. These complementary foods can be prepared at home from commonly used
 food materials such as cereals (wheat, rice, jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/dals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, 
 sesame oil etc.), sugar and jaggery. <b>According to WHO</b>,
 <ul>
 <li>Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life.
 <li>Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.
 <li>From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient dense complementary foods.

</dt><b>Points to Remember</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>Start breast-feeding within an hour after delivery and do not discard colostrum.
<li>Breast-feed exclusively (not even water) for six months.
<li>Continue breast-feeding in addition to nutrient-rich complementary foods preferably up to 2 years.
<li>Breast-milk alone is not enough for infants after 6 months of age. Complementary foods should be given after 6 months of age, in addition to breast-feeding.
<li>Feed low-cost home-made caloric and nutrient rich complementary foods
<li>Observe hygienic practices while preparing and feeding the complementary food for infants.
<li>Read nutrition label on baby foods carefully as children are most prone to infections.
<li>Avoid junk foods.
</ul>
<dt><h3>Diet for a Growing Child</h3></dt>
<dd>
Children who eat a balanced diet lay the foundation for a healthy and active lifestyle and this further lowers the risk of long term health issues. 
Childhood is the most critical time for growth as well as for development of the mind and to fight infections. So, it is very essential that the children 
get a good dose of energy, proteins, vitamins and minerals. It is very important to follow that hygienic practices are followed while preparing and feeding 
the complementary food to the child; otherwise, it might lead to diarrhoea. A well formulated balanced diet is necessary for children and adolescents to 
achieve optimum growth and boost their immunity. 
Development of bone mass is going on during this period so inclusion of dairy products (milk, cheese, yoghurt) and vegetables like spinach, broccoli and 
celery which are rich in calcium is a must.
In case of children, proteins are essentials for muscle building, repair and growth and building antibodies. So give them diet which has meat, eggs, fish 
and dairy products.
A child needs vitamins for the body to function properly and to boost the immune system. A variety of fruits and vegetables of different colours should be 
added in child’s food. Vitamin A is essential for vision and a deficiency of the same can lead to night blindness (difficulty in seeing in night). 
Dark green leafy vegetables, yellow, orange coloured vegetables and fruits (such as carrots, papaya, mangoes) are good sources of Vitamin A.
 Children get most of their Vitamin D from sunlight and a 
small amount from some food items like (fish oils, fatty fish, mushrooms, cheese and egg yolks).
Now a days, children are more inclined towards junk food but it is very important to motivate your kids in teenage to eat nutrition rich foods.

</dt><b>Points to Remember</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>Take extra care in feeding infants and include soft cooked vegetables and seasonal fruits.
<li>Give plenty of milk and milk products to children and adolescents as calcium is needed for growth and bone development.
<li>Encourage your child for outdoor activities and promote appropriate lifestyle practices like washing your hands before meals, brushing your teeth twice a day, hygiene practices to name a few.
<li>Avoid overeating during a single meal. Eat at frequent intervals.
<li>Exposure to sunlight helps maintains vitamin D which helps in calcium absorption.
<li>Never starve the child. Feed energy-rich cereals-pulse diet with milk and mashed vegetables.
<li>Use oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with zinc tablet to prevent and control dehydration during diarrhea episodes.
</ul>
<dt><b>Diet for an Adult Male & Female</b></dt>
<dd>
As an adult male and female, you must take care of your diet. Adults generally complain of time crunch and with sedentary lifestyle, it becomes even more difficult to follow a strict diet. Adults should use salt in moderation as high intake of salt might lead to high blood pressure. One should avoid preserved foods such as pickles/ papads and also canned foods as it contributes to higher intake of salt. An adult female should take a diet which is rich in calcium (Milk & dairy products) as well as iron (green leafy vegetables-spinach, broccoli etc.) Limit use of saturated fats and trans fats such as ghee, butter, cheese, vanaspati ghee and add more fibrous food in diet in the form of whole grains, vegetables and fruits.
<br><br><img src="adult.png" class="infant" height=50% width=65%></dd><br><br>
<dt><b>According to WHO, a healthy diet for adults contains</b></dt>
<ul>
<li>Fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice).
<li>At least 400grams (5 portions) of fruits and vegetables a day. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots are not classified as fruits or vegetables.
<li>Unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, sunflower, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard). Industrial trans fats (found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and spreads) are not a part of a healthy diet.
<li>Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to approximately 1 teaspoon) per day and use iodized salt.
